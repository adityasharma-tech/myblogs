title: "Hi, I'm a Programmer"

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm a programmer passionate about building things with code.

## ðŸ§  Languages I Use

- **C++** â€“ For performance-critical applications and system-level programming.
- **C** â€“ The foundation of everything, and a great tool when you need total control.
- **Python** â€“ My go-to for scripting, automation, and rapid prototyping.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Powering interactivity on the web.
- **HTML & CSS** â€“ Crafting structured and styled front-ends.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Doing Here

This site is powered by **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and written in Markdown â€” because I love tools that get out of the way and let me focus on content.

Stay tuned for posts, snippets, and maybe even some side projects.
